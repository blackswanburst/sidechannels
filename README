This is a collection of time baseded side-channel tools.

Enum-OpenSSH.py is a file that enumerates OpenSSH 5.x and 6.X users. The bug was
discovered back in 2006 by Marco Ivaldi, and I read about it here:

https://cureblog.de/2013/07/openssh-user-enumeration-time-based-attack/

I chose to write my own code for learning purposes.Its now been tested on both LANs 
and WANs, for versions 5.3, 5.3p1, 5.9p1, 6.0p1. 

Initially it works from a list of common users, and if it finds one, it appends
that user back to the top of the list when it write back out. This keeps the list
of users loosely ranked over multiple runs. Then it moves on to brute forcing if
the user wishes to do so. Again if a user is found it is added to the list, to 
improve future uses.

During testing it has been discovered that users without passwords, or who are not
allowed SSH users will not be discovered (Makes sense, but stated here for clarity).
For example this is why root is sometimes not discovered on a linux machine.

Shout outs go to @t3rminalV & @reverseICS for providing machines to do the WAN testing
and to Fernando Arnaboldi for suggestions to improve usability.
